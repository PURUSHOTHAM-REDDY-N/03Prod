   - ✅ Simplified DOM update logic in curriculum.js for more consistent behavior
   - ✅ Ensured proper width updates by removing unnecessary style manipulations
   - ✅ Maintained consistent behavior for the "complete" class (for 100% confidence)
   - ✅ Verified that topic confidence bars update correctly for both confidence changes and priority toggles

2. **Previous Fix: SQLAlchemy Import Issue in confidence.py**
   - ✅ Added explicit SQLAlchemy dependency to requirements.txt
   - ✅ Updated import statements in app/models/confidence.py to explicitly import sqlalchemy

     - `Subtopic` model for detailed subtopics
     - `TopicConfidence` for tracking topic confidence
     - `SubtopicConfidence` for tracking subtopic confidence
   - ✅ Created curriculum HTML template (`app/templates/curriculum/index.html`)
   - ✅ Implemented curriculum CSS (`app/static/css/curriculum.css`)
   - ✅ Implemented curriculum JavaScript (`app/static/js/curriculum.js`)
   - ✅ Created curriculum API endpoints (`app/routes/curriculum.py`)
   - ✅ Added curriculum data importer (`app/utils/curriculum_importer.py`)
   - ✅ Updated memory bank to reflect the new implementation

### UI Enhancement Details:

1. **Glass Morphism Implementation**
   - Implemented true glass-like transparency where background is visible through UI elements
   - Enhanced blur effects (16px) for better glass-like appearance
   - Reduced opacity of container backgrounds for improved transparency

   - Updated relationship definitions in both User and Task models to avoid conflicts
   - In User model: Changed the backref to avoid naming conflicts
   - In Task model: Removed duplicate relationship definition
   - Created database tables using `db.create_all()` and initialized with `flask init-db`

2. **Task Generation Parameter Mismatch**
   - Fixed `generate_tasks_in_batch` function to correctly pass User object instead of user_id to `generate_replacement_task`
   - Updated error handling for database initialization

### Best Practices Established:

#### Frontend Template Best Practices:

1. **Always quote template variables** used in JavaScript function calls
2. **Use data attributes** for complex data or when direct embedding causes syntax issues
3. **Use JSON serialization** (`|tojson` filter) for complex data structures
4. **Move logic to dedicated JavaScript functions** rather than embedding directly in attributes
5. **Avoid duplicate HTML attributes** by properly combining classes

#### JavaScript Architecture Best Practices:

1. **Standardize module export names** for better maintainability
2. **Use proper Promise handling** for asynchronous operations
3. **Centralize calculations** in appropriate layers (API vs client)
4. **Implement consistent error handling** throughout the application
5. **Use PascalCase for module objects** and standardize naming conventions

#### Backend Dependency Management:

1. Ensure all dependencies listed in requirements.txt are properly installed
2. Verify imports are working before beginning development
3. Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies

#### SQLAlchemy Relationship Management:

1. Avoid duplicate relationship definitions between models
2. Use appropriate naming for backref relationships to prevent conflicts
3. Consider using explicit relationship definitions with back_populates instead of backref
4. Initialize database properly with the correct sequence (create tables, then seed data)
5. Handle parameter type consistency when passing data between functions

### Upcoming Work:

1. **Further Mobile Responsiveness Improvements**:
   - Test on additional screen sizes and device types
   - Enhance navigation menu behavior on very small screens
   - Implement optimized touch interactions for mobile devices

2. **Database and ORM Refinements**:
   - Continue refining relationship definitions across all models
   - Add comprehensive validation across model interactions
   - Implement more robust database integrity checks
