# Progress

## Project Status
**Current Phase**: Feature Development

The Timetable project has transitioned from bug fixing to feature development. We have successfully completed the MVP release with core task management and progress tracking functionality. We've also successfully implemented the curriculum management system and enhanced the UI with a modern glass morphism design.

## Recent Fixes

### Updated Topic Confidence Bar Implementation & Subtopic Loading (3/12/2025)
We've completely reimplemented the topic confidence bar and changed the subtopic loading approach for better performance and reliability. The key improvements include:

1. **Code Improvements:**
   - Completely rewrote the topic confidence bar implementation with enhanced animations
   - Fixed issues where topic confidence bars weren't updating reliably for new users by using a more robust initialization approach
   - Changed subtopic loading from dynamic/on-demand to all-at-once for better performance and usability
   - Added enhanced status messages and loading indicators
   - Improved memory management by properly clearing confidence caches
   - Enhanced CSS with cleaner transitions and state indicators for loading/success/errors
   - Enhanced topic selection to handle subtopics without needing to reload them

2. **Confidence Bar Enhancements:**
   - Implemented a smooth transition effect by resetting the bar width to 0 before animating to the new width
   - Used requestAnimationFrame for smoother animations with better performance
   - Added better color handling based on confidence level ranges (1-20, 21-40, etc.)
   - Maintained special animation effect for 100% confidence levels
   - Made confidence value display clearer with better positioning

3. **Testing:**
   - Tested with newly created users to verify proper initialization
   - Verified topic confidence bars update correctly when subtopic confidence changes
   - Confirmed all subtopics load properly and can be viewed by switching topics
